Who does GDPR apply to and why is it important?,"GDPR applies to any organization functioning within the European Union (EU), as well as any organizations functioning outside the EU that offer goods or services to customers or businesses within the EU. GDPR aims to ensure that the personal data of individuals is gathered legally with careful considerations to individual consent. It also requires organizations that collect and use personal data to ensure the safety of this data. It gives individuals greater control over deciding how their data must be collected, stored, or processed. If you elect to delete your PII information from this community, we will permanently anonymize your content contributions and attribute the content to an Anonymous User. The Anonymous User will have a standard username and a default avatar to distinguish itself from other users."
Can I delete any identifying information of devices I've used on the community?,"Yes. If GDPR is enabled on this community, you can opt to delete device-related information from your account, specifically the IP addresses which have been used by this account and the mobile device associated with the account. To delete information related to your devices: Sign in to the community. Open the user menu and click My Settings. Go to Personal > Personal Information. Scroll down to the Device Identifiers list.

Can I download my community content and personal information?,"Yes. When GDPR is enabled, you can opt to download your community content and personal information associated with your account for offline storage/reference. If you decide to leave the community, you can download this content before you close your account. To download your Community Content and Personal Information: Sign in to the community. Open the user menu and click My Settings. Go to Personal > Personal Information. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click one or both of the download links.

What is an Accepted Solution?,"An Accepted Solutions is a way for you to choose the reply that best answers a question that you've posted. When you accept a solution, both the question and the solution get special icons and links that take you directly from the question to the answer. An Accepted Solutions icon also appears on boards and in search results so you can see which messages have solutions. You can mark a solution as accepted only for questions that you've posted (you started the thread). Community moderators can also mark one of the replies to a message as an accepted solution"
How do I mark a message as a solution?,"To mark a message as a solution, click Accept as Solution on the reply. If you change your mind or if another reply provides an even better answer, you can revoke the first selection and accept the second reply. To revoke an accepted solution, click Options > Not the Solution. You can choose another solution or leave the question unsolved."
What are Kudos?,"Kudos is a content rating system that lets you vote for the messages you think are the most useful or important. When you give kudos to a message, you are giving a thumbs-up for good content and a pat on the back to its author. Your kudos help to boost the value of certain messages and enhance the reputation of their authors. Giving kudos is as easy as a single click, but the impact of kudos ripples across the community."
How do I give Kudos?,"You can give Kudos to any posts in the community except your own. To give kudos to a message and its author, click Kudos on the message. If you change your mind about the quality of the message, you can revoke your kudos. To revoke kudos you've given, click the Kudos button again."
How can I see who's given me Kudos?,"Want to know who thinks a message is good? It's easy to find out which regular community members and community experts have given kudos to a message. Kudos from community experts can carry more weight than those from brand new members. (Community administrators can choose to have kudos granted by experts carry more weight than kudos granted by regular members.) To see who's given you kudos: Go to the message page. Click the Kudos total. The Who Kudoed this Message page shows you all the community members who've given kudos to the message. Click Experts to see kudos given by high-ranking members of the community. Experts are usually moderators and other users who had a kudos weight of more than 1 when they gave the message kudos. Click the Date Kudoed, User ID, or or kudos link to sort this page by the date the kudos were given, the name of the user who gave kudos or by the kudos count."
How can I see which messages or authors have received the most Kudos?,"There are usually two kudos leaderboards on the community's front page -- one for authors and another for messages. The author's leaderboard shows who has received the most kudos. The message leaderboard showcases the most kudoed messages. Links from the front-page leaderboards take you to the full leaderboard pages. To view the Top Kudoed Messages leaderboard, click view all from the front page module. To view the Top Kudoed Authors leaderboard, click view all from the front page module."
How can I see who has given me kudos?,"To see who's given you kudos: Go to you profile page. Your Profile pages shows the names of community members who have given you kudos, the messages they kudoed, your top kudoed messages, and the kudos you've given. To see all of your recent kudos activity in an area, click view all. Click the tabs to see more info about your kudos activity."
What is Kudos weight?,"Your kudos weight is the number of kudos you give each time you click Kudos!. If you're new to the community, your kudos weight is probably 1 (each kudo counts as 1). More experienced community members might have a higher kudos weight, so they could give two kudos, ten kudos, or more each time they click."
Why can't I give Kudos to some messages?,"There are a few reasons why you might not be able to give Kudos to a post. You've already given Kudos to this message (you can only give them once). You wrote the message (you can't Kudo your own messages). Your community manager wants you to give Kudos only to a message that starts a thread and not to replies. Your community manager has turned Kudos off for a message or a forum. Your community manager has frozen Kudos for this message. You can still see how many Kudos the message has received, but you can't Kudo it any more."
Where did the Kudos number go?,"Sometimes a message gets so many kudos that we run out of space to show the number. When that happens, you'll see a Hot Kudos symbol or icon instead of the kudos count on the kudos badge."
What is a tag?,"A tag is a single keyword or phrase that describes the topic, theme, or subject of a post. You can add as many tags as you want and so can other community members. For example, in a post about a mouse, you might add these tags: mouse, USB mouse, optical mouse, wireless, DPI. Be sure to use commas between tags."
What is a tag cloud?,"A tag cloud displays tags used frequently within the community or within an area of the community. The more frequently a tag is used, the larger it appears in the tag cloud. By looking at a tag cloud, you can get a sense of what the hot topics are in a given area."
What can I do with tags?,"Tagging is a way to help other users discover interesting posts. It's also a way to organize content in the community that you think is related. When you apply tags to a post, you add to the value by providing another way for people to find it."
Why do people tag?,Some users will tag posts for their own convenience in finding them later. Other users enjoy helping categorize interesting posts for the benefit of the community. Users who tag lots of posts gain status by appearing on Tag Leaderboards.
How do I tag?,To add a tag: Navigate to an interesting post or comment. Click in the Add field and type your tags (separated by commas). Click Add Tag.
Where are my tags?,You can find messages you've tagged by visiting your profile and clicking the tag. You can also click on a tag on any cloud and look at the Most Tagged section.
What are labels?,"Labels are used within a community to help categorize articles in a variety of discussion styles; forums, blogs, Q&A, ideas, TKBs. Labels enable you to categorize the content you write based on the themes or content in the article. For example, in a support Q&A for troubleshooting connectivity issues with your smart phone, you might apply labels like ""iPhone"", ""Galaxy"", ""AT&T"", or ""Verizon"". Unlike tags, labels are created by the Community Admin and typically controlled for consistency and need. Authors must choose/apply labels from a pre-defined list for the node in which the article appears. Tags are more freeform and can be created by authors."
How do I add a label to my post?,"To add a label: Navigate to the post you authored. Open the post to edit it. In the Labels field, start typing the label or choose one from the list. If you add multiple labels, you must separate them with commas."
Who can create labels?,"Typically, only administrators or permissioned members can create new labels or edit the label list. When the use of labels is enforced, members must apply a label when submitting posts. Labels can be optionally predefined, giving administrators complete control over exactly which labels are used in their community. Labels are applied at node (board) level, so different settings can be applied at different boards. One board might be mandatory with a predefined pool of labels, while another can be completely optional and enable users to create their own labels."
How do I subscribe to a label?,"When you subscribe to a label, you will be notified by email when a new post is created with the label. To subscribe to a label: From a particular post with a label, click on the label to filter by that label. (You can also do this from the labels component.) Click Subscribe. Note:Your community users can configure their own subscription settings under My Settings > Subscriptions and Notifications > My Subscriptions and My Settings > Subscriptions and Notifications > Notification Settings. One thing to note about labels is that they are applied at node level. Thus, predefined labels and subscriptions to labels exist only at the node at which they are applied. For example, if you subscribe to a label named 'contest' at board 1, it will not automatically subscribe you to an identically named label at board 2. You will have to subscribe twice, once at each board. This also applies if you add a labels component to your page to display the most popular labels, these are also designed to work at node level."
